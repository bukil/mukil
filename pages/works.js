                    The Bugatti Chiron is a luxury sports car designed and produced by Bugatti Automobiles
                S A S The car is named after the French racing driver Louis Chiron The Chirons design was led by Bugattis 
                head designer Etienne Salom√© and is an evolution of the Veyron design It features a sleek and aerodynamic 
                body with a long hood and a low wide stance The cars front fascia is characterized by its large curved grille 
                and LED headlights while the rear features a distinctive LED light strip and a large integrated spoiler The Chirons 
                body is made of carbon fiber which helps keep the cars weight down and improves its performance The cars interior is 
                also designed with luxury and performance in mind with premium materials advanced technology and a minimalist design But 
                since I cant afford one I decided to create one in Blender a free and open source 3D modeling software, as you can see.

                    Koenigsegg CC850, a rare and powerful supercar that can reach speeds of over 400 km/h. 
                    I wanted to design my own version of it in Autodesk Sketchbook, a versatile and easy-to-use 
                    drawing app on my phone and here is the powerful design journey of the Koenigsegg CC850.

                    From DNA Arc and framework to symbol of Elegant Hypercars the engine is one of its kind and literally known as 
              Powerplant. I started by creating a new sketch and choosing a orthogonal orientation. added some finishing touches 
              to the car design. I added some reflections glares and sparkles to make it look more shiny and dynamic.

                    The Bugatti Chiron is a luxury sports car designed and produced by Bugatti Automobiles
                S A S The car is named after the French racing driver Louis Chiron The Chirons design was led by Bugattis 
                head designer Etienne Salom√© and is an evolution of the Veyron design It features a sleek and aerodynamic 
                body with a long hood and a low wide stance The cars front fascia is characterized by its large curved grille 
                and LED headlights while the rear features a distinctive LED light strip and a large integrated spoiler The Chirons 
                body is made of carbon fiber which helps keep the cars weight down and improves its performance The cars interior is 
                also designed with luxury and performance in mind with premium materials advanced technology and a minimalist design But 
                since I cant afford one I decided to create one in Blender a free and open source 3D modeling software, as you can see.

              Powerplant. I started by creating a new sketch and choosing a orthogonal orientation. added some finishing touches 
              to the car design. I added some reflections glares and sparkles to make it look more shiny and dynamic.
