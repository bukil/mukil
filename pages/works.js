                    The Bugatti Chiron is a luxury sports car designed and produced by Bugatti Automobiles
                S A S The car is named after the French racing driver Louis Chiron The Chirons design was led by Bugattis 
                head designer Etienne Salom√© and is an evolution of the Veyron design It features a sleek and aerodynamic 
                body with a long hood and a low wide stance The cars front fascia is characterized by its large curved grille 
                and LED headlights while the rear features a distinctive LED light strip and a large integrated spoiler The Chirons 
                body is made of carbon fiber which helps keep the cars weight down and improves its performance The cars interior is 
                also designed with luxury and performance in mind with premium materials advanced technology and a minimalist design But 
                since I cant afford one I decided to create one in Blender a free and open source 3D modeling software, as you can see.

              From DNA Arc and framework to symbol of Elegant Hypercars the engine is one of its kind and literally known as 
              Powerplant. I started by creating a new sketch and choosing a orthogonal orientation. added some finishing touches 
              to the car design. I added some reflections glares and sparkles to make it look more shiny and dynamic.

          This project is a part of my internship at E-Yantra Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) I was working as a product designer in team, where we were Designing a multipurpose Drone structure. 
One of my projects was to visualize the 3D Drone concept under the mentorship of Mr. Maddu Murali and we named it TAREN. Taren is a stealth multipurpose drone inspired by a tarantula spider which shows the symbol of aggression and speed, Taren is not only equipped with aesthetics but intelligence also This is why we have wicked smart NVIDIA¬Æ Jetson Xavier onboard.
